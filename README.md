# Curriculum Vitae

Curriculum Vitae (CV) developed using [Astro](https://astro.build/), a modern web
framework designed for generating static content. The primary goal is to create a
structured and customizable CV that can be easily printed or converted to PDF, ensuring
full control over the design and layout. By using `Astro`, it will be compiled into a
single static `index.html`, which provides a reliable and consistent way to render it
across different browsers and devices.

## Language Disclaimer

The CV content is currently written `only in Spanish`, but this will not affect the core
functionality of the project. The generated `index.html` will remain fully usable across
languages. The project's source code and documentation, however, are in `English` to
maintain international accessibility for developers.
